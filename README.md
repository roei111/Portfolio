# Roei Yaacobi - Portfolio

<h4>My portfolio is a single page application created using React.js. It has really cool features like an interactive 3D element that I implemented with the Three.js library, you can even move it with your fingers or mouse. There are some animations when you load the page, I implemented those with the Framer Motion library. Also, there is a dark and light theme and an image carousel to showcase all my projects.</h4>
